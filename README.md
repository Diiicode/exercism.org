# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org).  
It serves as a record of my learning journey and growth as a programmer.

## Current Focus
I’m currently focusing on the **C track**, sharpening my skills in:
- Pointers and memory management  
- Recursion and algorithms  
- Data structures and low-level programming  
- Writing clean and efficient code  

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a programming language track.  
- Exercises are organized by their Exercism names and include my implementations.  
- The focus will expand to other languages in the future, but for now **C** is the main priority.  

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Develop strong foundations in C and low-level systems programming  
- Build consistency in writing clean, testable, and maintainable code
